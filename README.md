Besides three solar panels, the levels have:

a bird enemy NPC that follows the player if they are too close and drops a projectile attack when it is above the player.
a friendly NPC that follows the player if they get too close and if the player is being followed by the bird enemy , the friendly NPC scares it away.
a consumable pick up item which restores 5 HP to the player.




This game also features a random level layout creation for each new game that is started. The layout is similar to the tic tac toe game and the three solar panels, the enemy and friendly NPC and the consumable pick up are all placed randomly in the level.
